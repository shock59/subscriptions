# Subscriptions

A web app to keep track of your favourite YouTube channels without needing a YouTube account. This service can be useful if you enjoy using YouTube and staying up to date with your favourite creators, but don't want to sign up for a Google account (or can't because of a ban in your country).

Built using SvelteKit. Currently the site is in development and I am constantly improving it, if you have any suggestions feel free to contact me using the email found on [my website](https://samv.me).
